    "There exist different pair of object depth and motion that could satisfy the photometric constraint. However, it is difficult to determinine which is the correct. This is the root of the scale ambiguity issue in dynamic region. \n",

    "* Start with an unsupervised depth estimation approach for static region.\n",
    "* Employ an object depth network to estimate depth of moving objects.\n",
    "* For each moving object, the DSA module predicts a scalar to align the object depth scale to the scale of the static region.\n",
    "* Depth maps after the alignment are used as pseudo labels to train a final depth network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depth Scale Alignment module (DSA)\n",
    "* **Goal** : (1) Align the scale of static and dynamic regions and (2) Extract scale-consistent pseudo depth labels.\n",
    "* **Training** : Predict a scalar $\\beta^o$ to eliminate the depth scale difference of individual static objects.\n",
    "$$ L_{scale} = \\sum{| \\beta^o \\mathbf{D}^o_r - \\mathbf{M}_r^o \\odot \\mathbf{D}_r^{scene} | } $$\n",
    "* **Inference** : For each dynamic object, predict a scale $\\beta^o$ to solve its depth scale ambiguity issue. The pseudo depth label is then constructed from the scaled object depth and depth of the static background. \n",
